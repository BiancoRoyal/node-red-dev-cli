# Min node-red version

## Requirements
Within the `node-red` section of the package.json file the developer SHOULD indicate the minimum supported version. This must satisfy at least one of the current `latest` or `maintenance` tagged releases.

e.g.
```js
"node-red"  : {
    "version": ">=2.0.0",
}
```

## Reason
This is so that users can identify nodes that rely on new features in latest versions of node-red.

# Min node version

## Requirements
Within the `engines` section of the package.json file you SHOULD declare the minimum version of Node that your package works on.
This SHOULD satisfy the current minimum supported version of the latest node-red release.
```json
{
  "engines": {
    "node": ">=12.0.0"
  }
}
```
## Reason
Node-RED has supported multiple versions of Node in its history and some of these have become end of life, this helps users identify if a node will run on their installation.

# License

## Requirement
The package.json MUST contain a key of `license` that specifies the type of license used, this can be either an open source licence or your own proprietary license. The value should be either a recognised [SPDX ID](https://spdx.org/licenses/) Or refer to a filename within the package for a custom license.

## Reason
The package must specify a license so that users can have confidence they are permitted to use it and understand any restrictions on its use.

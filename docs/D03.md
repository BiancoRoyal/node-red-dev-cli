# Out of Date Dependencies

## Requirements
The tool will check the dependencies listed in the package.json and if there is a newer version that does not satisfy the stated version it will flag a warning.
For example if your dependencies are:
```json
{ "acme" : "~1.0.0"}
```
And the latest version of acme is 1.1.3 then this will not warn as the latest version will be installed when the package is added to node-red.
However if acme is at 2.0.0 it would flag a warning.

## Reason
Packages are often updated to include security fixes so users should be able to use the newest version available.
Where your package needs to use an older version this should be noted in the README

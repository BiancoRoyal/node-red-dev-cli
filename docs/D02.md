# Bad Packages 

## Requirements
The tool will check that any packages with known incompatibilities to Node-RED core are not used in the dependency tree.

## Reason
As of Oct 2021 there has only been one package that caused an issue, (agent-base <6.0.0). However this facility allows us to expand this list should the need arise in the future.
